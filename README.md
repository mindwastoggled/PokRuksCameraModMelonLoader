## Main Exclusive Features
* No camera delay, no more laggy cosmetics **glitching** on the camera.
* Settings save: smoothing, camera clipping, FOV — all that **automatically saves**, so you don't need to set it up every time you restart the game.
* Toggleable Head Cosmetics Hide feature for first person view camera
* Toggleable Roll Lock feature
* Adjustable camera activation bind.
* You can adjust camera bind settings at runtime, no need to restart the game.
* Spectating other players
* You can now switch spec mode to first person through the gui as well
* First person roll lock

## Controls
* Press your camera activation bind to spawn the camera in front of you (see the controls config guide below).
* Hold the grip on the banana handle to grab the camera.
* Press **Tab** on the IRL keyboard for monitor UI.
* Use **WASD/arrow keys** for freecam (also a toggle for the gamepad).

### How to Set Camera Activation Bind
1. Start the game with the mod running at least once.
2. Open the `YourGameRootFolder/CameraMod/Configs/Controls.json` config.
3. Set the `activateBind` to the aliases of the buttons you want:

| Alias | Generic meaning | Quest 2 controllers meaning |
|----------|----------|----------|
| RP   | Right Primary  | A |
| RS   | Right Secondary  | B |
| LP   | Left Primary   | X  |
| LS   | Left Secondary | Y  |
4. Save the file and watch controls change immediately (you don't need to restart the game).

### Examples
If you want to bind the camera activation to multiple buttons, set the config bind value like this:

`Controls.json`
```json
{
  "activateBind": "RP RS LP LS"
}
```
If you want to bind it to just the Right Primary button (which is A for Quest 2 controllers):

`Controls.json`
```json
{
  "activateBind": "RP"
}
```
And so on.
